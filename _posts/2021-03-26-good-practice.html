<p>Over the years physicists started studying topics that were not traditionally considered to be a part of physics. PHYSICS OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Flocks of birds</h2>

<p> A physics joke tells that in order to describe a cow's milk production we can model it as a sphere, but this is not far from the truth. 
    In our description a bird is a triangle wandering in a 2-dimensional world togheter with its mates and it is carachterized by a certain velocity vector.
    In this first part of the analysis each bird will have the same velocity in magnitude of 1 m/s and just different orientations. 
    To understand how ordered flocks emerge from the behaviour of single birds we first need a quantity to quantify the amount of order in our flock.
    We introduce the so called order parameter that we represent with the greek letter ϕ and calculate using the following procedure: 
    <ul>
      <li> we sum using the head-tail technique all the birds velocities vectors
      <li> we divide the resulting vector length by the number of birds in our system
      <li> the order parameter is this final vector length measured in m/s
    </ul>  
    Since our birds have a speed of 1 m/s, the order parameter is bounded between 0 and 1. If they had different velocities in magnitude the formula for 
    the order parameter would be slightly more complicated in order to be in the range between 0 and 1, but we'll stick to the first case for simplicity.
    Now let's see how this quantity gives us information about the amount of order in our grop of birds.

<h2 class="section-heading">Magnetic systems</h2>
In many materials single atom are arranged in lattices and these structures contribute to determine many properties of the material, together with
the atoms properties. Now we want to study how magnetism arises in material starting from a simple model in analogy with the flocks model that we 
developed before. In this case the role played by birds is now taken by the atoms: they are freezed on their lattice site but they can rotate around this pivot point.
