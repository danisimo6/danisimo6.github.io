<p>Over the years physicists started studying topics that were not traditionally considered to be a part of physics, but that could be described in terms
  with theories similar to the ones developed in physics. Swarms of insects, crowds of people, flocks of birds and many other systems seemed to be well suited to be studied with the language
  of thermodynamics. Why are all these seemingly completely different systems so similar to this branch of physics that we study in high school? The 
  core idea is that, in all these cases, we sort of know the the rules followed by the single constituents of the system. For examle, in an ideal gas we
  know how the single atoms behave: they . But since we have a huge amount of them we cannot describe the gas by following each atom's behaviour and we
  study the system by defining average global properties like temperature and pressure that can still be derived from the the single constituents.
  To see it we'll introduce a topic studied by the 2021 Nobel prize laureate Giorgio Parisi who studied quantitatively bird flocks, in a similar manner 
  to how he described magnetic, to describe where their ordered behaviour comes from. Of course Parisi used a lot of mathematics but if you remember 
  the head-tail technique for vector summation you can learn some interesting stuff.

<h2 class="section-heading">Flocks of birds</h2>

<p> A physics joke tells that in order to describe a cow's milk production we can model it as a sphere, but this is not far from the truth. 
    In our description a bird is just a triangle wandering in a 2-dimensional world togheter with its mates and carachterized by a certain velocity vector.
    In this first part of the analysis each bird will have the same velocity in magnitude of 1 m/s but different vector orientations. 
    To understand how ordered flocks emerge from the behaviour of single birds we first need a quantity to quantify the amount of order in our flock.
    We introduce the so called order parameter that we represent with the greek letter ϕ and calculate using the following procedure: 
    <ul>
      <li> we sum using the head-tail technique all the birds velocities vectors
      <li> we divide the resulting vector length by the number of birds in our system
      <li> the order parameter is this final vector length measured in m/s
    </ul>  
    Since our birds have a speed of 1 m/s, the order parameter is bounded between 0 and 1. If they had different velocities in magnitude the formula for 
    the order parameter would be slightly more complicated in order to be in the range between 0 and 1, but we'll stick to the first case for simplicity.
    Now let's see how this quantity gives us information about the amount of order in our group of birds using two examples. 
    
    In the one depicted in Fig.1, we see twenty birds flying in parallel and if we try to calculate the order parameter using the rules explained before
    we get ϕ = 1. Indeed, if we sum all their velocity vectors, with magnitude 1 m/s, we get a total vector of magnitude 20 m/s that we need to divide 
    by twenty, the number of birds, and get rid of the m/s units to get ϕ = 1. This is in agreement with our intuition of an ordered flock: the birds fly
    together.

In Fig.2, we see what we expect to be a disordered bird system. If we try to calculate ϕ we obtain a zero value because they are all pointing in
different directions. In the head-tail part of the order parameter calculation, each bird has a mate with a velocity equal in magnitude but opposite 
direction so they cancel each other and ϕ = 0.

<h2 class="section-heading">Magnetic systems</h2>
<p>
In many materials single atom are arranged in lattices and these structures contribute to determine many properties of the material, together with
the atoms properties. Now we want to study how magnetism arises in material starting from a simple model in analogy with the flocks model that we 
developed before. The system can be magnetic because the single atoms can be thought as little magnets with a north and a south pole, like the ones
that you stick to your fridge, and they are characterized by a vector quantity called magnetic dipole moment or spins. This is a vector with the north-south
magnet direction as orientation and a magnitude that tells us how much magnetic it is.
Our material is magnetic because all the dipole moments in our lattice, a 2-dimensional square lattice for simplicity, are parallel to each other
like in Fig.6, thanks to their particular interaction that we won't describe
in detail. You can use the order parameters rules that we introduced for birds and calculate how much ordered the system is.

<p>   </p>
<p>   
Of course the system depicted in Fig.6 is perfectly ordered and the order parameter, usually called magnetization, is ϕ = 1. But magnetic systems 
ae not always magnetic: if we overcome a certain temperature called Curie temperature they lose their magnetic properties because they start having
oscillation around their pivot point in the lattice and the magnetization is zero. Fig.7 depicts this situation: the dipole moments point at 
random direction so you get a zero length vector when you sum all them up. The Curie temperrature depends on the atoms properties and the lattice on
which they are positioned and it is called the system critical temperature: as we move from above it to a lower temperature we go from a disordered
system to an ordered one getting a phase transition.

<p>   </p>

<p>   
A system like this, in which below a certain temperature all the spins are parallel to each other, is called a ferromagnetic material.
There are a lot of different class og magnetic materials like antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and spin glasses. The studying of the latter
was one of the reason thanks to which Parisi won the 2021 Nobel prize but a detailed explanation of their propertiesis beyond the scope
of this article. It is sufficient to say that on analogous way to the glass composing our house windows, spins are always orientated in 
seemingly random directions but if we llok clodely there is a critical temperature below which the system is "less" disordered
